# Isoform Project
**Goal:** quantify and describe the presence of different gene isoforms (variant transcripts of a gene produced by alternative splicing) in RNA-seq data

Sample Visualization [R Notebook](https://github.com/daviemel/isoform_project/blob/main/sample_viz.Rmd)
* Uses Bioconductor functions
* Includes set-up for both RefSeq and Ensembl references
* Plots figure including the following: 1) coverage, 2) sashimi, and 3) gene isoform models
